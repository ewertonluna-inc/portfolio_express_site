# Node.js and Express Portfolio Website
### Static Node.js and Express Site to showcase built projects.

 The goal of this project is to create a portfolio site to showcase other projects built so far since I started studying Full Stack JavaScript development. <br>
 On the main page, there are thumbnails for each project that link to the project's page.<br>
 On the project's pages, you will find a live link to test out the application and also the github repo.<br>
